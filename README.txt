For the programming assignment 3, I have used Python as the programming language.
Name of the program my-dvr.py
Name of the network file: network.txt

Imports are as follows:
from threading import Thread
import socket
from copy import deepcopy

To run the program, make sure that my-dvr.py and network.txt
are in same directory; network.txt is hardcoded in the program.

An example run of the program will be:
$> python my-dvr.py
